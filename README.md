# **Backend Development Journey with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**

Welcome to my repository! 🚀  
I am currently on a learning journey to master **backend development** using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. This repository documents my progress as I explore backend concepts from the basics to advanced topics.

---

## **📚 What I’m Learning**

### **Core Concepts**
- Setting up a Node.js environment.
- Working with Express.js for server-side development.
- CRUD operations with MongoDB.
- Understanding the MVC architecture.

### **Authentication and Authorization**
- User authentication with **JWT** and **OAuth**.
- Role-based and permission-based authorization.
- Secure password handling with **bcrypt**.

### **Advanced Features**
- Integrating payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- File uploads (e.g., images, PDFs) using tools like **Multer**.
- Sending transactional emails (e.g., account verification, password resets).
- Real-time features with **WebSockets**.
